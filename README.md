# Beauty-n-Beasts
### About the App
Beauty and Beasts is the app that will help you live your best life with the perfect furry friend. If you have skin concerns that you're afraid will be exacerbated, let us help you find the breed that perfectly complements your beauty routine and enhances your wellness journey

### How it works
Our app allows users to share their skin concern and be matched with a dog breed that would compliment that concern. There are certain qualities about a dog's breed that may worsen existing skin conditions so our app crunches the numbers for you to help you find the right companion to live your healthiest life with.

 Users can also simply look though a list of 279 dogs and learn more about them in order to make a more informed decision before adopting their future fur baby.

## Try it yourself
Check out the deployed app [here](https://beautynbeasts.netlify.app). 

## Run it yourself
If you'd like to instead clone and run the app on your local host, here are a few things you'll require:
* [Angular CLI](https://v17.angular.io/cli#installing-angular-cli) by running the following command:
    * ```npm install -g @angular/cli@17```
* cd into your cloned project and run npm install:
    * ```cd beauty-and-beasts```
    * ```npm install```
* Serve the application
    * ```ng serve```

By following these steps, your application should be running at http://localhost:4200/

## Check out the API 
Although the application itself does not query a database, we do utilize the [Dogs API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs) provided by API Ninjas for our dog profiles. 

Without a way to send a query that would provide the information of all dogs, we thought it best to store the data ourselves to then utilize throughout the app. Therefore, use/knowledge of the API is not necessary. 

Besides this, there were no other changes made or APIs used.
